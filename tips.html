                If you're looking for some advice about buying games without going broke, read on! <br>
                My name is Kian, and I'm a huge video game fan. I enjoy so many different genres and games, but I didn't have
                the money to afford all of the different games I wanted when I was growing up.
                So I got good at finding great deals on games, allowing me to play more <strong>without</strong> taking a huge hit to my wallet.
                My tips will help you out whether you're looking to buy the more expensive AAA games, or the cheaper indie games.<br>
                I'll also share the ways I find new games to put on my wishlist.

            <h2>How to track sales and view sale price history</h2>
            <h3>Patience can get you a great deal</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="borderL">
            It might be tempting to buy a game as soon as it releases, but some games actually go on deep discounts less than only 1 year after release!
            <a src="file://wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/kiface/schoolProjects/HTML-and-CSS-capstone-project/links.html">Deku deals</a> and
            <a src="file://wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/kiface/schoolProjects/HTML-and-CSS-capstone-project/links.html">Steamdb</a>
            are sites that can show you when a game went on sale and for how much over the course of its lifetime.
            This is helpful because you can see which Developers put their games on sale really fast, and which ones don't.
            For example, most Playstation games will eventually go to 50%-66% off, but most Nintendo games will barely go on sale,
            and when they do it is usually only for up to 33% off, so it might not be worth the wait for them. I'm talking about sales directly from their storefronts,
            but Deku deals and Steamdb track sales from third-party sources (like Amazon) too! Looking at sale history, you can find many other publishers that
            have 50% off sales at the 1 year mark, or even the 6 month mark! So if you are interested in a game, check the publishers habits
            when it comes to putting their games on sale. You might see you only have to wait a few months to save a bunch. <br>
            Why else is waiting ok? Many games today will not be in their final state when they are first released. It's been
            extremely common for games to get post launch updates that include significant fixes, QoL features, or new content.
            So waiting can also be beneficial so you can get the full game experience the first time you play.

            <h2>Some Choices</h2>
            <h3>Digital vs Physical? Console vs PC?</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="borderL">
            Sale price history is tracked for both digital and physical versions of a game. Sometimes
            the digital version will be cheaper, and if that's what matters most to you, then it is an easy choice.
            But what else is there to consider with digital vs physical? First, an added discount for digital is using
            a trick from Costco. Costco sells Nintendo and Playstation store cards for 10% off (they always have this deal!).
            So if you plan to buy digital, getting these can add to your savings. Digital sales also have NO SALES TAX, saving you even more! <br>
            But some people value physical games more due to security when it comes to game preservation.
            Some digital games have been removed from online stores, online stores can close down as a new console is made (preventing redownloads),
            and in rare cases, purchased digital games have been removed from users accounts.
            It's not so clear though, as many physical games still utilize "day 1 patches" which need to be downloaded from the internet.
            Potentially leaving you with an incomplete game if you can't access that patch years down the line.<br>
            Even if you choose digital, there is a choice between console and PC. A really popular storefront for PC games is Steam.
            Some games on Steam integrate the "Steam workshop" which allows users to create custom mods for the game.
            Some mods are simple visual tweaks, but sometime they are high quality content packs! If you want to get
            the most out of a game, check what mods are available and if they are appealing. Excluding the rare exceptions,
            mods are only available on PC, giving you a reason to consider that as your platform.

            <h2>Finding Games You Might Like</h2>
            <h3>Getting Recommendations and Reviews</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="borderL">
            Not all games are advertised equally. Indie games have less of a budget for advertisement, but many
            1st or 2nd party games aren't advertised as much as the most popular ones. So you can be rewarded for
            looking into games you might like instead of relying on those games coming to you.
            Good ways to find new games are by checking out content creators on Youtube orlooking at a genre list on a storefront
            like Steam and checking out the top rated ones. There are SO many game genres out there, and indie games
            sometimes have genres/genre combos that are so unique and not seen in AAA games. The Steam store does a good
            job of showing you similar games you might like after you've found one that you really click with.
            You can also search their genre list and look at the most popular. Typically, a game with an "overwhelmingly positive"
            rating (95% or higher positive ratings with at least 1000 reviews) on steam means something. That does NOT mean
            that games rated lower are bad! If you can find a few games you like and search them on Youtube, you haave a good chance
            of being recommended videos by content creators with similar interests as you.
