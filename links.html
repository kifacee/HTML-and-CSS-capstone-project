            The following links might help you on your quest to search for deals or to find new games that interest you.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li class="link">
                <a href="https://www.dekudeals.com/" target="_blank">Deku Deals</a>
                <p class="linkDesc">
                    A site where you can view the price history of any game on Nintendo Switch or Ps4/Ps5.
                    If you make an account and put a game on your wishlist, you can get a notificatoin whenever
                    there is a price drop of a certain amount.
                    Viewing the price history of a game can give you a feel for how often and how large of a discount
                    the publisher discounts their game for. There are many publishers that do deep discounts
                    even before their game is 1 year old!
                </p>

            <li class="link">
                <a href="https://steamdb.info/" target="_blank">Steamdb</a>
                <p class="linkDesc">
                    If you play your games on PC through the Steam store, then check steamdb instead.
                    It allows you to view the price history of any game from the steam store. It has the same benefits as
                    Deku deals, except it isn't as easy to browse and doesn't have a notification system as far as I'm aware.
                    But if you put a game on your Steam wishlist through the Steam store, they can notify you of discounts there. <br>
                    Steam tags can get messy, but the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" class="hover">Steam store</a> does a good job
                    at recommending games that are similar to one you know you like.
                    Checking the highest rated games in a genre can make it easier for you to find one that interests you!

                <p class="linkDesc">
                    A Youtuber that has his finger on the indie scene, mainly of the roguelike genre.
                    His content is great if you want exposure to lesser known indie games.
                    He gives great commentary that both new and experienced gamers would like.
                    He is very good at explaining his thought process for making decisions in games,
                    and frequently will "break" games by finding a really optimal interaction.

                <p class="linkDesc">
                    If you want LONG reviews, check out Tim Rogers at Action Button.
                    His content is filled with comedy, but extremely deep analysis on certain games.
                    Less about finding new games, more if you are interested in hearing someone go beyond
                    the surface level when talking about a video game.

                    A database of almost every game released. You can make lists to keep track
                    of games you've played or are interested in across platforms.
                    A good database if you want to look at the highest rated games of a genre or console generation.
